    <h1>Сorrect perception of information</h1>
    <p>In a world where truths can blur,<br>
    Information's path we must ensure.<br>
    To see the facts, clear and bright,<br>
    We must question all, and seek the light.<br><br>

    Our minds must sift, not take for granted,<br>
    What’s shown, what's said, what’s planted.<br>
    With open eyes, we must engage,<br>
    And let our wisdom guide the stage.<br><br>

    Perception shifts with every view,<br>
    So understand, not just pursue.<br>
    Truth is not just what you see,<br>
    But how it fits with all you believe.<br><br>

    So listen close and seek what's real,<br>
    For truth and knowledge, we must feel.</p>
